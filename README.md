# PMR_Code_Base
This repository contains a python script which consists of functions which can perform actions such as:
-	Input a CSV file and convert it to JSON
-	Input a CSV file and present a data summary
-	Input a CSV file and generate a SQL insert statement for all rows in the input

If the script is being run on the windows command line then the prerequisites could include installing packages such as:
- python3 -m pip install pandas
- python3 -m pip install unidecode

- An insight report of the dataset
- Docker file & requirement.txt file. Attempted to complete this task but was unable to due to an error with respect to some i.o package in python.
